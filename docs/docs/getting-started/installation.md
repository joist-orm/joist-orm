Installing Joist in your project has four main steps:

1. Setting up your database
2. Setting up `joist-codegen`
3. Setting up your tests
4. Setting up your production code

A wrinkle is that each Node.js application can be pretty different, in terms of how you manage your local database (i.e. with Docker Compose), what your production application looks like (a REST API, a GraphQL API, etc.), etc.

So, to simplify this page, we'll include some assumptions based on the [Joist sample app](https://github.com/joist-orm/joist-sample), but you should be able to adjust these steps to your specific project.

If you want a faster intro than this page, you should be able to check out the sample app, run the commands in its readme, and just start poking around.

:::info

Joist requires Node 18.

:::

## Setting up your database

The sample app uses `docker compose` and a `db.dockerfile` file to manage the local Postgres database.

To start it, clone the [sample app](https://github.com/joist-orm/joist-sample), and run:

```bash
docker compose build db
docker compose up -d db
```

The `docker-compose.yml` exposes the `sample_app` database on port `5342`, so it is accessible with an environment variable of:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgres://sample_user:local@localhost:5432/sample_app
```

The following steps will assume your database is available at this location (it is already set in the sample app's `env/local.env` file), but you can set `DATABASE_URL` to whatever is appropriate for your application.

### Setting up migrations

You should also set up a migrations library to manage your database schema; the Joist sample app uses [node-pg-migrate][1].

If you do use `node-pg-migrate` as well, you can install Joist's `node-pg-migrate`-based helper methods (like `createEntityTable`, `createEnumTable`, `createManyToManyTable`, etc.):

```bash
npm add --save-dev joist-migration-utils
```

And add `joist-migrate` and `joist-new-migration` commands to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "joist-migrate": "env-cmd tsx ./node_modules/joist-migration-utils",
    "joist-new-migration": "npx node-pg-migrate create"
  }
}
```

The sample app uses `env-cmd` to load the environment variables from `.env` before running `joist-migration-utils`, and `tsx` to transpile the migration's `*.ts` code to JavaScript, but if you don't like that, you can manage your application's environment variables however you like.

:::info

Invoking Joist's `joist-migration-utils` is really just a tiny wrapper around `node-pg-migrate` that:

- Reads the connection config from either a single `DATABASE_URL` or multiple `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USER`, and `DB_PASSWORD` environment variables
- Runs the "up" command against the `migrations/` directory

If you want to invoke `node-pg-migrate`'s [cli](https://salsita.github.io/node-pg-migrate/#/cli) directly instead, that's just fine.

:::

Now we can apply migrations by running:

```bash
npm run joist-migrate
```

The sample app also supports resetting the database schema (so you can re-run the migrations from scratch) by running:

```bash
docker compose exec db ./reset.sh
```

:::tip

While we used `node-pg-migrate` for this section, Joist is agnostic to your migration tool and will codegen based on your database schema, so you're welcome to use [node-pg-migrate](https://github.com/salsita/node-pg-migrate), Knex's [migrations](http://knexjs.org/guide/migrations.html#migration-cli), or another tool for migrations/schema management.

:::

:::tip

As a quirk of `node-pg-migrate`, the first migration that it creates via `joist-new-migration` will always be a `.js` file.

Once you rename that first migration to a `.ts` file, all subsequent migrations will be created as `.ts` files.

:::

## Setting up `joist-codegen`

Install the `joist-codegen` package as a dev dependency and add a `joist-codegen` script to your `package.json`:

```shell
npm add --save-dev joist-codegen
```

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "joist-codegen": "env-cmd tsx ./node_modules/joist-codegen"
  }
}
```

This again uses `env-cmd`, as `joist-codegen` will use the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to connect to your local database.

Now, anytime you make schema changes (i.e. by running `npm run joist-migrate`), you can also run `joist-codegen` to create/update your domain model:

```bash
npm run joist-codegen
```

## Setting up your tests

We want each test to get a clean/fresh database, so we should set up a `beforeEach` to invoke our local-only `flush_database` command:

The sample app does this via a `setupTests.ts` file that will be used for all tests:

```typescript
import { EntityManager } from "src/entities";
import { knex as createKnex, Knex } from "knex";
import { PostgresDriver } from "joist-orm";
import { newPgConnectionConfig } from "joist-utils";

let knex: Knex;

// Knex is used as a single/global connection pool + query builder
function getKnex(): Knex {
  return (knex ??= createKnex({
    client: "pg",
    connection: newPgConnectionConfig() as any,
    debug: false,
    asyncStackTraces: true,
  }));
}

export function newEntityManager(): EntityManager {
  return new EntityManager({}, new PostgresDriver(getKnex()));
}

beforeEach(async () => {
  const knex = await getKnex();
  await knex.select(knex.raw("flush_database()"));
});

afterAll(async () => {
  if (knex) {
    await knex.destroy();
  }
});
```

The `newPgConnectionConfig` helper method from `joist-utils` also uses the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable, which we can have loaded into the Jest process by using `env-cmd` in a `setupTestEnv.js` file:

```typescript
import { GetEnvVars } from "env-cmd";

export default async function globalSetup() {
  Object.entries(await GetEnvVars()).forEach(([key, value]) => (process.env[key] = value));
};
```

And then configure `jest.config.js` to use both files:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  preset: "ts-jest",
  globalSetup: "<rootDir>/src/setupTestEnv.ts",
  setupFilesAfterEnv: ["<rootDir>/src/setupTests.ts"],
  testMatch: ["<rootDir>/src/**/*.test.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}"],
  moduleNameMapper: {
    "^src(.*)": "<rootDir>/src$1",
  },
};
```

:::info

While Joist's `newPgConnectionConfig` uses the same environment variable convention as `joist-codegen`, with the idea that your app's production environment variables will be set automatically by your deployment infra (i.e. in the style of [Twelve Factor Applications](https://12factor.net/)), you're free to configure `Knex` with whatever idiomatic configuration looks like for your app.

See the [Knex config documentation](http://knexjs.org/guide/#configuration-options).

:::

As usual, you can/should adjust all of this to your specific project.

Now your unit tests should be able to create an `EntityManager` and work with the domain objects:

```ts
import { Author, EntityManager, newAuthor } from "src/entities";
import { newEntityManager } from "src/setupTests";

describe("Author", () => {
  it("can be created", async () => {
    const em = newEntityManager();
    const a = new Author(em, { firstName: "a1" });
    await em.flush();
  });
});
```

## Setting up your production code

Finally, you can use the `EntityManager` and your domain objects in your production code.

First install the `joist-orm` dependency:

```bash
npm add --save-dev joist-orm
```

This is where the guide really becomes "it depends on your application", but in theory it will look very similar to setting up the tests:

1. Configure a single/global `knex` instance that will act as the connection pool,
2. For each request, create a new `EntityManager` to perform that request's work

An extremely simple example might look like:

```ts
import { EntityManager, Author } from "./entities";
import { newPgConnectionConfig, PostgresDriver } from "joist-orm";
import { knex as createKnex, Knex } from "knex";

// Create our global knex connection
let knex: Knex = createKnex({
  client: "pg",
  connection: newPgConnectionConfig(),
  debug: false,
  asyncStackTraces: true,
});

// Create a helper method for our requests to create a new EntityManager
function newEntityManager(): EntityManager {
  // If you have a per-request context object, you can create that here
  const ctx = {};
  return new EntityManager(ctx, new PostgresDriver(getKnex()));
}

// Handle GET `/authors`
app.get("/authors", async (req, res) => {
  // Create a new em
  const em = newEntityManager();
  // Find all authors
  const authors = await em.find(Author, {});
  // Send them back as JSON
  res.send(authors);
});
```

Note that you'll again need the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable set, but that will depend on whatever hosting provider you're using to run the app (or, per the previous disclaimer, you're free to configure the `Knex` connection pool with whatever configuration approach/library you like).
