Joist's mission is to help you build great domain models.

The original inspiration was to bring [ActiveRecord](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html)-level productivity to TypeScript projects, but with bullet-proof N+1 prevention, and bringing reactivity to the backend, we have arguably already surpassed that goal.   

Joist's primary features are:

- [Code Generation](./code-generation.md) to move fast and remove boilerplate
- [Bullet-Proof N+1 Prevention](./avoiding-n-plus-1s.md) through first-class [dataloader](https://github.com/graphql/dataloader) integration
- Bringing [Reactivity to the Backend](../modeling/reactive-fields.md)
- Robust [Domain Modeling](../modeling/fields.md)
- Strict type-safe tracking of [Loaded vs. Unloaded Relations](./load-safe-relations.md)
- [Great testing](./great-tests.md) with built-in factories and other support
