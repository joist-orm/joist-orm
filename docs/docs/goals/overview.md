Joist's mission is to bring [ActiveRecord](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html)-level productivity to TypeScript/Node projects.

Joist's primary goals/differentiators are:

- Using [code generation](./code-generation.md) to move fast and remove boilerplate
- [Avoiding N+1s](./avoiding-n-plus-1s.md) through first-class [dataloader](https://github.com/graphql/dataloader) integration
- Strict "load-safe" tracking of [loaded vs. unloaded collections](./load-safe-relations.md) in the type system
- Robust [domain modeling](../modeling/fields.md) and [bringing reactivity to the backend](../modeling/derived-fields.md)
- [Great testing](./great-tests.md) with built-in factories and other support
