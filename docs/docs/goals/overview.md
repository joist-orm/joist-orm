Joist's goal is to bring [ActiveRecord](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html)-level productivity to TypeScript/Node projects.

This is a lofty goal, and Joist has just started down that road, but that is the standard Joist strives for and ideally can surpass.

The major goals are:

- Use [code generation](./code-generation.md) to move fast and remove boilerplate
- [Avoid N+1s](./avoiding-n-plus-1s.md) through first-class [dataloader](https://github.com/graphql/dataloader) integration
- Differentiate [loaded vs. unloaded collections](./type-safe-relations.md) in the type system
- Enable [great testing](./great-tests.md) with built-in factories and other support
- Provide a variety of primitives of domain modeling options
