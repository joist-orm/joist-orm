### Appropriately Null/Not Null Properties

Null and not null columns are correctly modeled and enforced, i.e. a table like:

```
                                        Table "public.authors"
    Column    |           Type           | Collation | Nullable |               Default
--------------+--------------------------+-----------+----------+-------------------------------------
 id           | integer                  |           | not null | nextval('authors_id_seq'::regclass)
 first_name   | character varying(255)   |           | not null |
 last_name    | character varying(255)   |           |          |
```

Means the domain object `Author` will appropriately null/non-null properties:

```typescript
class AuthorCodegen {
  get firstName(): string
    return this.__orm.data["firstName"];
  }

  set firstName(firstName: string) {
    setField(this, "firstName", firstName);
  }

  get lastName(): string | undefined {
    return this.__orm.data["lastName"];
  }

  set lastName(lastName: string | undefined) {
    setField(this, "lastName", lastName);
  }
}
```

And the non-null `firstName` is also non-null on construction:

```typescript
new Author(em, { firstName: "is required" });
```

I.e. you cannot call `new Author()` and then forget to set `firstName`.

The appropriate null/non-null-ness is also enforced in the `Author.set` method:

```typescript
author.set({ firstName: "cannotBeNull" });
```

Although `set` does accept a `Partial`, so if you don't want to change `firstName`, you don't have to pass it to `set`:

```typescript
author.set({ lastName: "..." });
```

### `EntityManager.create` marks collections as loaded

The `EntityManager.create` method types the newly-created entity's collections as already loaded.

I.e. this code is valid:

```typescript
const author = em.create(Author, { firstName: "asdf " });
expect(author.books.get.length).toEqual(0);
```

Even though normally `books.get` is not allowed/must be a lazy `.load` call, in this instance `create` knows that the `Author` is brand new, so by definition can't have any existing `Book` rows in the database that might need to be looked up, so can turn the `books` collection into a loaded collection, i.e. with the `get` method available.

### Derived Columns

If you mark a field as derived in `joist-codegen.json`, it will not have a setter, only an `abstract` getter than you must implement, and that Joist will call to use as the column in the database.

```json
{
  "derivedFields": ["Author.initials"]
}
```

Note that this currently only works for primitive columns, and the getter must be synchronous.

### Protected Columns

If you mark a field as protected in `joist-codegen.json`, it will have a protected setter that only your entity's business logic can call. The getter will still be public.

```json
{
  "protectedFields": ["Author.initials"]
}
```

### Automatic Null Conversion

Joist generally prefers to use `undefined` where ever possible, i.e. columns that are `null` in the database are returned as `undefined`.

```typescript
// Given `authors` row id=1 has last_name=null
const author = em.load(Author, "1");
// Then the domain object treats it as `undefined`
expect(author.lastName).toBeUndefined();
```

And methods that allow setting `lastName` will accept `null` and convert it to `undefined`:

```typescript
const newLastName: string | undefined | null = null;
author.set({ lastName: newLastName });
// `lastName` is converted to `undefined`
expect(author.lastName).toBeUndefined();
```

And when saved to the database, `undefined`s are converted back into `null`s.

(Note that the `author.lastName` setter does not accept `null` because in TypeScript the types of getters and setters must be exactly the same, and so Joist can't "allow setting `null`" while "enforcing `null` will not be returned". Helper methods like `Entity.set` do not have this restriction, and so can accept `null`s and do the `null` to `undefined` conversion for callers.)

### Support for Partial Update Style APIs

A common pattern for APIs is to treat `null` and `undefined` differently, i.e. `{ lastName: null }` specifically means "unset the `lastName` property" while `firstName` being not present (i.e. `undefined`) means "do not change `firstName`".

These APIs can be difficult to map to Joist's opinionated approach of "required properties must never be passed as `null` or `undefined`", so Joist has two helper methods for building partial-update-style APIs: `EntityMangaer.createPartial` and `Entity.setPartial`.

I.e. for a non-null `firstName` and nullable `lastName` fields that both come in (from an RPC call or GraphQL mutation) as the "partial update" type of `string | null | undefined`, `Author.setPartial` allows directly passing both fields:

```typescript
const author = em.load(Author, "1");
const firstName: string | null | undefined = incomingFirstName;
const lastName: string | null | undefined = incomingLastName;
// Calling set is a compile error because set's firstName must be a string
// @ts-expect-error
author.set({ firstName, lastName });
// Call setPartial will compile
author.setPartial({ firstName, lastName });
}
```

And the runtime behavior is:

- `firstName: "foo"` will update `firstName`
- `firstName: undefined` will noop
- `firstName: null` will be a runtime error
- `lastName: "bar"` will update `lastName`
- `lastName: undefined` will noop
- `lastName: null` will unset `lastName` (i.e. set it as `undefined`)

The `EntityManager.createPartial` constructor method has similar semantics.

Arguably the ideal partial-update type for `Author` in this scenario would be:

```typescript
interface AuthorInput {
  firstName: string | undefined;
  lastName: string | null | undefined;
}
```

Which would alleviate the need for `setPartial`, but it's sometimes hard to express this nuance in RPC/API type systems that generate the `AuthorInput` TypeScript type, i.e. in particular GraphQL's type system cannot express the difference between `firstName` and `lastName` with a partial-update style input type like:

```graphql
type AuthorInput {
  firstName: String
  lastName: String
}
```

There is also a `EntityManager.createOrUpdatePartial` method that will conditionally create-or-update an entity, while accepting partial-update/"`null`-means-unset" opts (and, per above, still apply runtime validation that no required fields are unset):

```typescript
// Partial-update-typed variables from incoming API call
const id: number | undefined | null = 0;
const firstName: string | undefined | null = "...fromApi...";
const mentorId: number | undefined | null = 1;
const newBooks: Array<{ title: string | undefined | null }> = [{ title: "...fromApi..." }];
await em.createOrUpdatePartial(Author, {
  id,
  firstName,
  mentor: mentorId,
  books: newBooks,
});
```

Note how, unlike the `create` and `set` methods that are synchronous and so only accept `Entity` values for opts like `mentor` and `books`, `createOrUpdatePartial` accepts partials of references/collections and will recursively `createOrUpdatePartial` nested partials into the appropriate new-or-found entities based on the presence of `id` fields.

This effectively mimicks Objection.js's [`upsertGraph`](https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/guide/query-examples.html#graph-upserts), with the same disclaimer that you should only pass trusted/white-listed keys to `createOrUpdatePartial` (i.e. keys from a validated/subset GraphQL input type) and not just whatever form fields the user has happened to HTTP POST to your endpoint.

### Fast database resets

To reset the database between each unit test, Joist generates a stored procedure that will delete all rows/reset the sequence ids:

```typescript
await knex.select(knex.raw("flush_database()"));
```

This is generated at the end of the `joist-migation-utils` set only if `ADD_FLUSH_DATABASE` environment variable is set, i.e. this function should never exist in your production database. It is only for local testing.

(Some ORMs invoke tests in a transaction, and then rollback the transaction before the next test, but this a) makes debugging failed tests extremely difficult b/c the data you want to investigate via `psql` has disappeared/been rolled back, and b) means your tests cannot test any behavior that uses transactions.)

### Auto-Refreshing Test Instances

The `EntityManager.refresh` method reloads all currently-loaded entities from the database, as well as any of their loaded relations (i.e. if you have `author1.books` loaded and a new `books` row is added with `author_id=1`, then after `refresh()` the `author1.books` collection will have the newly-added book in it).

This is primarily useful for tests, where you want to do behavior like:

```typescript
// Given an author
const a = em.create(Author, { ... });
// When we perform the business logic
// (...assumme this is a test helper method that invokes the logic and
// then calls EntityManager.refresh before returning)
await run(em, (em) => invokeBusinessLogicUnderTest(em));
// Then we have a new book
expect(a.books.get.length).toEqual(1);

// Defined as a helper method
async function run<T>(em, fn: async () => Promise<T>): Promise<T> {
  // Flush existing test data to the db
  await em.flush();
  // Make a new `em` however that is done for your app
  const em2 = newEntityManager();
  // Invoke business logic under test
  const result = await fn(em2);
  // Reload our test's em to have the latest data
  await em.refresh();
}
```

This runs `invokeBusinessLogicUnderTest` in its own transaction/`EntityManager` instance (to avoid accidentally relying on the test's `EntityManager` state), but after `invokeBusinessLogicUnderTest` completes, the test's Author `a` local variable can be used for assertions and will have the latest & great data from the database.

Without this approach, tests often jump through various hoops like having duplicate `a1`/`a1Reloaded` variables that are explicitly loaded:

```typescript
const a1 = em.create(Author, { ... });
await invokeBusinessLogicUnderTest(em);
// load the latest a1
await a1_2 = em.load(Author, a1.idOrFail);
```

Joist's `EntityManager.refresh` method and the `run` helper method convention let's you avoid doing this "load the latest X" in all of your tests.

### Test Factories

Joist generates customizables factories for easily creating test data.

I.e. for a `Book` entity, Joist will one-time generate a `Book.factories.ts` file that looks like:

```typescript
import { EntityManager, FactoryOpts, New, newTestInstance } from "joist-orm";
import { Book } from "./entities";

export function newBook(em: EntityManager, opts?: FactoryOpts<Book>): New<Book> {
  return newTestInstance(em, Book, opts);
}
```

Tests can then invoke `newBook` with as little opts as they want, and all of the required defaults (both fields and entities) will be filled in.

I.e. since `book.author_id` is a not-null column, cailling `const b1 = newBook()` will create both a `Book` with a `title` (required primitive field) as well as create a new `Author` (required foreign key/many-to-one field) and assign it to `b1.author`:

```typescript
const b = newBook();
expect(b.title).toEqual("title");
expect(b.author.get.firstName).toEqual("firstName");
```

This creation is recursive, i.e. `newBookReview()` will make a new `BookReview`, a new `Book` (required for `bookReview.book`), and a new `Author` (required for `book.author`).

You can also pass partials for either the book or the author:

```typescript
const b = newBook({ author: { firstName: "a1" } });
// title was not in opts, so it gets the same default
expect(b.title).toEqual("title");
// author.firstName was in opts, so it's used for the firstName field
expect(b.author.get.firstName).toEqual("a1");
```

The factories will usually make new entities for required fields, but will reuse an existing instance if:

1. The `EntityManager` already as a _single_ instance of that entity. I.e.:

   ```typescript
   // We have a single author
   const a = newAuthor();
   // Making a new book will see "there is only 1 author" and assume we want to use that
   const b = newBook();
   expect(b.author.get).toEqual(a);
   ```

2. If you pass entities as a `use` parameter. I.e.:

   ```typescript
   // We have multiple authors
   const a1 = newAuthor();
   const a2 = newAuthor();
   // Make a new book review, but use a2 instead of creating a new Author
   const br = newBookReview({ use: a2 });
   ```
   
   This will make a new `BookReview`, and a new `Book`, but when filling in `Book.author`, it will use `a2`.
   
   (Note that `use` is specifically useful for passing entities to use "several levels up the tree", i.e. if you were making a `newBook` you could directly pass `newBook({ author: a2 })`. In the `newBookReview` example, author is not immediately set on the `BookReview` itself, so we put `a2` in the `use` opt for the factories to "use it as needed/up the tree".)

The factory files can be customized, i.e.:

```typescript
export function newBook(em: EntityManager, opts?: FactoryOpts<Book>): New<Book> {
  return newTestInstance(em, Book, {
    // Assume every book should have 1 review by default. This can be a partial that will
    // be recursively filled in. It will also be ignored if the caller passes
    // their own `newBook(em, { reviews: ... })` opt.
    reviews: [{}]
    // Give a unique-ish name, testIndex will be 1/2/etc increasing and reset per-test
    title: `b${testIndex}`
    ...opts
  });
}
```

And then every caller of `newBook` will get these defaults.

Note that you can also customize the `opts` type to add your own application-specific hints, i.e.:

```typescript
export function newBook(em: EntityManager, opts?: FactoryOpts<Book> & { withManyReview?: boolean }): New<Book> {
 // if opts?.withManyReview then make 10 reviews
}
```

### Tagged Ids

Joist automagically "tags" entity ids, which means prefixing them with a per-entity identifer.

For example, the value of `author1.id` is `"a:1"` instead of the number `1`.

There are a few reasons for this:

- It eliminates a class of bugs where ids are passed incorrectly across entity types.

  For example, a bug like:
  
  ```typescript
  const authorId = someAuthor.id;
  // Ops this is the wrong id
  const book = em.load(Book, authorId);
  ```
  
  Often these "wrong id" bugs will work during local unit tests because every table only has a few rows of `id 1`, `id 2`, so it's easy to have `id 1` taken from the `authors` table and accidentally work when looking it up in the `books` table.
  
  Note that Joist also has strongly-typed ids (i.e. `AuthorId`) to help prevent this, but those can only fix "wrong id" bugs that are internal to the application layer's codebase, i.e. the above example of reading an id from an entity and then immediately using it to look up the "wrong" entity (specifically the above code, even without tagged ids, is a compile error in Joist).
  
  However, tagged ids extends this same "strongly-typed ids" protection to API calls, i.e. if a client calls the API and gets back "author id 1" and then makes a follow up API call but accidentally uses that author id as a book id. Because we've crossed an API boundary (which generally have more generic id types, i.e. GraphQL's `ID` type is used for all objects), we need to use a runtime value to catch that "this id is not for the right entity".

  Granted, this will be a runtime error, but it will be a runtime error everytime time (i.e. even in local development when the "wrong id" often works by accident) instead of only showing up in production.

- It makes debugging easier because seeing ids like `a:1` in the logs, you immediately know which entity that is for, without having to also prefix your logging statements with `authorId=${...}`.

- GraphQL already uses essentially-strings/opaque `ID` types, and while Joist is technically GraphQL-agnostic, pragmatically implementing a GraphQL system is what drove most of Joist's development, so it was generally easy to support this in our APIs, so seemed like a low-hanging-fruit/easy-win.

Note that, in the database, the entity primary keys are still numeric / `serial` integers. Joist just auto-tags/detags them for you/for free.

For the tags, Joist will guess a tag name to use by abbreviating the entity name, i.e. `BookReview` --> `br`. If there is a collision, i.e. `br` is already taken, it will use the full entity name, i.e. `bookReview`. Tags are stored `joist-codegen.json` so you can easily change them if Joist initially guesses wrong.
 
Once you have a given tagged id deployed in production, you should probably never change it, i.e. in case id values like `a:1` ends up in a 3rd party system, changing your tagged id to `author:1` may break things.

Note that Joist will still look up "untagged ids" i.e. if you do `em.load(Author, "1")` it will not complain about the lack of a tag. However, if the tag value is wrong, i.e. `em.load(Author, "b:1")`, then it will be a runtime failure.

### Unit of Work-Level Query Cache

If you issue the same `EntityManager.find(Entity, { ...where... })` call multiple times within a single unit of work, the database query will only be issued once, and then the cached value used for subsequent calls.

If you do an `EntityManager.flush`, that will reset the find cache b/c the commit may have caused the cached query results to have changed.

Note that this is not a shared/second-level cache, i.e. shared across multiple requests to your webapp/API, which can be a good idea but means you have to worry about cache invalidation and staleness strategies.

This cache is solely for queries issued with the current unit of work, and it is thrown away/re-created for each new Unit of Work, so there should not be any issues with stale data or need to invalidate the cache (beyond what Joist already does by invalidating it on each `EntityManager.flush()` call).

(Pedantically, currently Joist's Unit of Work does not currently open a transaction until `flush` is started, so without that transactional isolation, Joist's UoW find cache may actually be "hiding" changed results (between `find` 1 and `find` 2) than if it were to actually re-issue the query each time. That said, a) ideally/at some point Joist's UoW will use a transaction throughout, such that this isolation behavior of not noticing new changes is actually a desired feature (i.e. avoiding non-repeatable reads), and b) UoWs are assumed to be extremely short-lived, i.e. per request, so you should generally not be trying to observe changed results between `find` calls anyway.)

### Validation Rules

Entities can have validation rules added that will be run during `EntityManager.flush()`:

```typescript
class Author extends AuthorCodegen {
  constructor(em: EntityManager, opts: AuthorOpts) {
    super(em, opts);
  })
}

authorConfig.addRule((author) => {
  if (author.firstName && author.firstName === author.lastName) {
    return "firstName and lastName must be different";
  }
});

// Rules can be async
authorConfig.addRule(async (author) => {
  const books = await authorthis.books.load();
  // ...
});
```

If any validation rule returns a non-`undefined` string, `flush()` will throw a `ValidationErrors` error.

If you would like to skip validation rules, you can pass `skipValidation: true` to `flush()`. Use this technique with caution, as it can create invalid entities.

### Tracking Changed Properties

Entities track which of their properties have changed:

```typescript
const a1 = em.load(Author, "1");
expect(a1.changes.firstName.hasChanged).toBeFalsey();
a1.firstName = "a2";
expect(a1.changes.firstName.hasChanged).toBeTruthy();
expect(a1.changes.firstName.originalValue).toEqual("a1");
```

### Lifecycle Hooks

There are two lifecycle hooks: `beforeFlush` and `afterCommit`:

```typescript
class Author extends AuthorCodegen {
  constructor(em: EntityManager, opts: AuthorOpts) {
    super(em, opts);
  }
}

authorConfig.beforeFlush(async () => ...);

authorConfig.afterCommit(async () => ...);
```

### GraphQL-Compatible Filters

Joist's `find` supports the standard "filter as object literal" pattern, i.e.

```typescript
const authors = em.find(Author, { age: { gte: 20 } });
```

And the generated `AuthorFilter` type that drives this query is fairly picky, i.e. `age: null` is not a valid query if the age column is not null.

This works great for TypeScript code, but when doing interop with GraphQL (i.e. via types generated by graphql-code-generator), Joist's normal `AuthorFilter` typing is "too good", i.e. while GraphQL's type system is great, it is more coarse than TypeScript's, so you end up with things like `age: number | null | undefined` on the GQL filter type.

To handle this, Joist generates separate GraphQL-specific filter types, i.e. `AuthorGraphQLFilter`, that can fairly seamlessly integrate with GraphQL queries with a dedicated `findGql` query methods.

I.e. given some generated GraphQL types like:

```typescript
/** Example AuthorFilter generated by graphql-code-generator. */
interface GraphQLAuthorFilter {
  age?: GraphQLIntFilter | null | undefined;
}

/** Example IntFilter generated by graphql-code-generator. */
interface GraphQLIntFilter {
  eq?: number | null | undefined;
  in?: number[] | null | undefined;
  lte?: number | null | undefined;
  lt?: number | null | undefined;
  gte?: number | null | undefined;
  gt?: number | null | undefined;
  ne?: number | null | undefined;
}
```

Joist's `EntityManager.findGql` will accept the filter type as-is / "directly off the wire" without any cumbersome mapping:

```typescript
// I.e. from the GraphQL args.filter parameter
const gqlFilter: GraphQLAuthorFilter = {
  age: { eq: 2 },
};
const authors = await em.findGql(Author, gqlFilter);
```

Also note that while the `age: { eq: 2 }` is a really clean way to write filters by hand, it can be annoying to dynamically create, i.e. in a UI that needs to conditionally change the operator from "equals" to "not equals", because there is not a single key to bind against in the input type.

To make building these UIs easier, `findGql` also accepts a "more-boring" `{ op: "gt", value: 1 }` syntax. The value of the `op` key can be any of the supported operators, i.e. `gt`, `lt`, `gte`, `ne`, etc.

### hasOneThrough

You can define common paths through your entity graph with `hasOneThrough`:

```typescript
export class BookReview extends BookReviewCodegen {
  readonly author: Reference<BookReview, Author, never> = hasOneThrough((review) => review.book.author);
}
```

The `hasOneThrough` DSL is built on Joist's `CustomReferences`, so will also work with `populate`, i.e.:

```typescript
const review = await em.load(BookReview, "1", { author: "publisher" });
expect(review.author.get.publisher.get.name).toEqual("p1");
```

### hasOneDerived

You can define a relation that is conditional with `hasOneDerived`:

```typescript
readonly publisher: Reference<BookReview, Publisher, undefined> = hasOneDerived(
  { book: { author: "publisher" } },
  (review) => {
    // some conditional logic here, but review is loaded
    return review.book.get.author.get.publisher.get
  },
);
```

This works a lot like `hasOneThrough`, but if useful for when you have conditional navigation logic, instead of a fixed navigation path.

### Cascading Deletions

You can have a parent cascade delete its children by doing:

```typescript
bookConfig.cascadeDelete("reviews");
```

You can also use database foreign key cascades, but using the domain-level `cascadeDelete` will mean that any application-layer hooks/validation logic/etc. that might need to run due to the review being deleted will be run during `em.flush()`.

Currently, Joist does not automatically cascade delete children; i.e. it could/may eventually use the database metadata of a foreign key with `ON CACADE DELETE` to know it should generate a `cascadeDelete(...)` in the base codegen file, but for now you have to manually specify any cascade deletions that you want.
