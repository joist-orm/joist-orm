Joist models all relations as async-by-default, i.e. you must access them via `await` calls:

```ts
const author = await em.load(Author, "a:1");
// Returns the publisher if already fetched, otherwise makes a (batched) SQL call 
const publisher = await author.publisher.load();
const publisherComments = await publisher.comments.load();
const books = await author.books.load();
```

We call this "load safe", because you can't accidentally access unloaded data, which results in a runtime error.

Which is great, but then to improve ergonomics and avoid tedious `await Promise.all` calls, Joist also supports marking relations as explicitly loaded, to enable synchronous `.get`, non-`await`-d access:

```ts
// Preload publisher, it's comments, and books
const author = await em.load(Author, "a:1", { publisher: "comments", books: {} });
const publisher = author.publisher.get;
const publisherComments = publisher.comments.get;
const books = author.books.get;
```

## Background

One of the main affordances of ORMs is that relationships (relations) between tables in the database (i.e. foreign keys) are modelled as references & collections on the classes/entities in the domain model.

For example, in most ORMs a `books.author_id` foreign key column means the `Author` entity will have an `author.books` collection (which loads all books for that author), and the `Book` entity will have a `book.author` reference (which loads the book's author).

In all ORMs, these references & collections are inherently lazy: because you don't have your entire relational database in memory, objects start out with just a single/few rows loaded (i.e. a single `authors` row with `id=1` loaded as an `Author#1` instance) and then lazily loaded the data you need from there (i.e. you "walk the object graph" from that `Author#1` to the related data you need).

## Async By Default

Because of the inherently lazy nature of references & collections, Joist takes the strong, type-safe opinion that if they _might_ be unloaded, then they _must_ be marked as `async/await`.

For example, you have to access `author.books` via an `await`-d promise:

```typescript
const author = await em.load(Author, "a:1");
const books = await author.books.load();
```

And you must do this each time, even if technically in the code path that you're in, you "know" that `books` has already been loaded, i.e.:

```typescript
const author = await em.load(Author, "a:1");
// Call another method that happens to loads books
someComplicatedLogicThatLoadsBooks(author);
// You still can't do `books.get`, even though "we know" (but the compiler
// does not know) that the collection is technically already cached in-memory
const books = await author.books.load();
```

## But Async is Kinda Annoying

While Joist's "async by default" approach is the safest, it is admittedly tedious when you get to double/triple levels of `await`s, i.e. to go from an `Author` to their `Book`s to each `Book`'s `BookReview`s:

```typescript
const author = await em.load(Author, "a:1");
await Promise.all((await author.books.load()).map(async (book) => {
  // For each book load the reviews
  return Promise.all((await book.reviews.load()).map(async (review) => {
    console.log(review.name);
  })); 
}));
```

Yuck.

Given this complication, some ORMs in the JavaScript/TypeScript space sometimes fudge the "collections must be async" approach, and allow you to model collections as _synchronous_, i.e. you're allowed to do:

```typescript
const author = await em.load(Author, "a:1");
// I promise I loaded books
await author.books.load();
// Now access it w/o promises
author.books.get.length;
```

Which is nice! But the wrinkle is that we're now trusting ourselves to only access `books` _after_ an explicit `load`, and if we forget, i.e. when our code paths end up being complex enough that it's hard to tell, then we'll get a runtime error that `books.get` is not allowed to be called

Because of this lack of safety, Joist avoids this approach, and instead has something fancier.

## The Magic Escape Hatch

Ideally what we want is to have relations lazy-by-default, except when we've explicitly told TypeScript that we've loaded them. This is what Joist does.

In Joist, populate hints (which tell the ORM to pre-fetch data before it's actually accessed) also _change the type of the entity_, and mark relations that were explicitly listed in the hint as loaded.

This looks like:

```typescript
const book = await em.populate(
  originalBook,
  // Tell Joist we want `{ author: "publisher" } preloaded
  { author: "publisher" });
// The `populate` return type is now "special"/MarkLoaded `Book`
// that has `author` and `publisher` marked as "get"-able
expect(book.author.get.firstName).toEqual("a1");
expect(book.author.get.publisher.get.name).toEqual("p1");
```

Note that `originalBook`'s `originalBook.author` reference does _not_ have `.get` available (just the safe `.load` which returns a `Promise`); only the modified `Book` type returned from `em.populate` has the `.get` method added `author.book`.

:::tip[Tip]

You can avoid having two `originalBook` / `book` variables by passing populate hints directly to `EntityManager.load`, which will then return the appropriate `.get`-able references:

```typescript
const book = await em.load(
  Book,
  "a:1",
  { author: "publisher" });
expect(book.author.get.firstName).toEqual("a1");
expect(book.author.get.publisher.get.name).toEqual("p1");
```

:::


Joist's `populate` approach also works for multiple levels, i.e. our triple-nested `Promise.all`-hell example can be written with a single `await`

```typescript
const author = await em.load(
  Author,
  "a:1",
  { books: "reviews" },
);
author.books.get.forEach((book) => {
  book.reviews.get.forEach((review) => {
    console.log(review.name);
  });
})
```

## Best of Both Worlds

This combination of "async by default" and "populate hint mapped types" brings the best of both worlds:

- Data that we are unsure of its loaded-ness, must be `await`-d, while
- Data that we (and, more importantly, the TypeScript compiler) are sure of its loaded-ness, can be accessed synchronously
