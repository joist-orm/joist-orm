## Key Features

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Type-safe Domain Models" icon="seti:typescript">
    <p>
      Robust [Domain Modeling](/modeling/why-entities/) that leverages TypeScript for compile-time safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      I.e. tracking [relation loaded-ness](/goals/load-safe-relations) in the type system.
    </p>
  </Card>
  <Card title="N+1 Safe by Default" icon="rocket">
    [Bulletproof N+1 Preventation](/goals/avoiding-n-plus-1s/) avoids N+1 query performance problems through batched loading and pre-loading.

    Any loops written using `Promise.all` will never N+1, regardless of complexity.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Backend Reactivity" icon="laptop">
    [Reactive Fields](/modeling/reactive-fields) and [validation rules](/modeling/validation-rules) bring the ergonomics of declarative business logic to the backend.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Rich Test Support" icon="test-tube">
    Out-of-the-box [test factories](/testing/test-factories) and [fast test database resets](/testing/fast-database-resets) make testing your code a breeze.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>
