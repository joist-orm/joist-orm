 * Prevents entities being mutated mid-flush.
 *
 * The `flush` process does a dirty check + SQL flush and generally doesn't want
 * entities to re-dirtied after it's done the initial dirty check. So we'd like
 * to prevent all setter calls while `flush` is running.
 *
 * That said, lifecycle code like hooks actually can make setter calls b/c `flush`
 * invokes them at a specific point in its process.
 *
 * We solve this by using node's `AsyncLocalStorage` to mark certain callbacks (promise
 * handlers) as blessed / invoked-from-`flush`-itself, and they are allowed to call setters,
 * but any external callers (i.e. application code) will be rejected.
