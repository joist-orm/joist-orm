/**
 * Represents the "many" side of a one-to-one relationship.
 *
 * I.e. in a one-to-many from Book -> Reviews, there is a review.book_id that can have many books.
 *
 * This class is for when that `review.book_id` column is itself unique, i.e. like `image.book_id`, and
 * so instead of `Book.images: OneToManyCollection` we have a `Book.image: OneToOneReference`.
 *
 * This class implements `Reference` because it is essentially like "one entity pointing/refereing to another",
 * however because we require a `.load` call to lazily know the value of other side (unlike ManyToOneReference
 * which has it's `book_id` column immediately available in the entity `data` hash), there is some wonkiness
 * around methods like `Reference.id` that are usually callable without `load`/`populate`, that for this
 * class can actually only be called post `load`/`populate`.
 *
 * Currently we enforce this with a runtime check, which is not great, but the trade-off of implementing
 * `Reference` seemed worth the downside of a un-type-safe `.id` property.
