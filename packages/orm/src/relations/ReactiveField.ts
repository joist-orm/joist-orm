 *
 * This allows callers (or SQL queries) to access the value without first calling
 * `await load()` on the property.
 *
 * So, unlike `AsyncProperty`, `.get` is always available; if the property is unloaded,
 * then `.get` will return the last-calculated value, but if the property is loaded,
 * then it will go ahead and invoke function to calculate the latest value (i.e. so
 * that you can observe the latest & greatest value w/o waiting for `em.flush` to
 * re-calc the value while persisting to the database.
