/**
 * Allows destructuring against entities to more succinctly access loaded relations.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // Instead of
 * const author = book.author.get;
 * // Use withLoaded
 * const { author } = withLoaded(book);
 * ```
 *
 * Granted, when accessing one property, this is not a win, but if you're accessing
 * ~3-4 separate loaded properties, then it can be more succinct than using `get`s
 * for each one.
 *
 * This function returns a proxy to an entity, instead of a real entity, and as such its return
 * value should only be used as part of a destructure and never directly assigned to a variable.
 *
 * This is also why the function is not recursive, as returning nested proxies could result in
 * them inadvertently being stored and passed to code that expects a real entity.
